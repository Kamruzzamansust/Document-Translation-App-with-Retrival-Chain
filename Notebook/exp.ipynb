       "[Document(metadata={'source': '82QusHUE9jk'}, page_content=\"the government in Bangladesh has imposed a nationwide curfew and called on the Army to help quell protests in which at least 67 people have been killed students have been demanding that ministers scrap a quota system which reserves many public sector jobs for the relatives of veterans of the country's war of independence the UN has said violence against the protesters has been shocking and unacceptable and a spokesperson for the Bangladesh police has said around 300 Bangladeshi police officers were injured during Friday clashes with demonstrators in multiple locations around the capital DCA let's now speak to Nami Hussein who is a professor of development studies at the school of Oriental and African studies welcome to the program could you explain a little bit if you would the background to these process and why there is a divide really over the legacy of the country's history well thank you for covering this story as you as you said it's getting very serious um the background really is that the immediate trigger in fact for the protests is this demand to reform the quota system in public sector employment more than half of all the jobs in the Bangladesh Civil Service are earmarked for particular categories but the contentious one is really the uh is the 30% that's supposed to be filled by families of the Freedom Fighters that's people who fought in the Liberation war in 1971 when Bangladesh got its uh independence from Pakistan and people believe that this 30% reservation is just another benefit for the followers of the ruling party but uh the students were really enraged when the Prime Minister made some sarcastic comments about the protests saying that these these protesters were the children of rakas which is a word we use to mean the traitors the people who collaborated with Pakistan during The Liberation war and this really inflamed things but since then these were initially peaceful protests they have been attacked since then by the ruling party student Wing the chu league and then by the police the Border guards and by the par paramilitary group RAB which is actually sanctioned by the US so the internet is now down uh it has been for over 24 hours there's a curfew state of emergency we don't know much about what's getting out but credible reports of over 100 100 deaths so far the broader context though and this is really important I think is that after a long period of quite successful successful development and economic growth Bangladesh has had a a cost of living crisis like much of the rest of the world um 10% inflation more or less this year very high levels of graduate and general unemployment and really critically all of this is taking place in a political system that's increasingly authoritarian the last two elections at the very least are not deemed to have been free or Fair the opposition Civil Society groups trade unions critics Scholars journalists have all faced intimidation disappearances violence and threats and in this context I think the the protests now have escalated well beyond a demand for quota reform uh and for accountability and Justice and we're also hearing uh demands for the res of the government and or the Prime Minister well indeed it's a reflection now of a broader dissatisfaction so briefly where is this heading it is very hard to say I think that uh the the likelihood that the government will topple uh or the Prime Minister resign as a result of this is very low the protesters have a lot a lot I would say almost Universal public support uh but this has gone very far now um there have been a lot of deaths there's been a lot of violence uh there's also a lot of anger within the government I think on the attacks on infrastructure including the brand new Metro stations um which I think is symbolic of of of people saying there's all this development all this growth but none of it's coming to us um I think that it's very unlikely that we'll see the end of this um aami League regime in the short term but for sure they've lost their legitimacy whatever shreds of legitimacy they had they those have all gone now n hin thank you very much indeed\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'rU63Mpr5-Q4'}, page_content=\"welcome to ask DW live streaming on YouTube as well I'm bires panaji and this is the program where we want to hear from you your questions your comments today we're talking about the situation in Bangladesh where restrictions are being eased there in that country after the Army was brought in to quell protests which were sparked by the resumption of government job quarters now the United Nations says latest reports indicate more than 100 1 70 people were killed in the unrest and is calling for a probe into the violence the mostly student protesters argue that the government policy reserving a third of its jobs for veterans of Bangladesh's Independence war and their families was a form of patronage the country's top court has since cut that quota to 5% and I have two great guests with me to talk about the situation in Bangladesh and to answer your questions and to take your comments as well DW reporter Bish jaaved who most of you will probably be aware of she has been following these protests over the past few days uh in with a lot of detail she's been speaking to a number of protesters as well and whatever has come out of that you will hear from in this conversation and joining me from Malmo in Sweden is tasnim KH M tasim lives in Malmo he's also the editor-in chief of NRA news that offers investigations and Analysis of events in Bangladesh welcome tasim and welcome pish I'm glad that both of you are here Bish let's just go to you first you've been following these protests for quite some time and in recent days we've seen in Bangladesh a state of curfew the internet cut the Army deployed what is the situation right now B the situation appears to be normal uh curfew has been relaxed um and we see uh Life coming back to normal but this normality has come at a huge cost the government says uh as you've mentioned there have been a lot of uh uh violence uh in these protests we know that at least more than 150 people were killed the government does say that they have set up a investigation and they deny being behind this violence and put the blame basically on the opposition but Bish during these protests we saw um how the government of Bangladesh used all its power and its might uh to suppress this student movement and now we have also seen videos that have appeared on social media where police brutality is quite visible um some of these videos have been verified by Amnesty International um and we can start with one of the videos that really made rounds on internet we we will talk about those videos in a bit but let's just uh go to the first because Ste just at the outset I'd like uh your opening comments on this who would you say is responsible for the chaos that engulfed Bangladesh uh prime minister sheikina uh two words or four words actually uh she has the ultimate responsibility of whatever has been happening in the country this whole crisis started from a very nonchalant comment from her calling the protesters with legitimate demands uh prenis of razakar or collaborators uh that's how this whole thing snowballed into the crisis so I mean if you are uh if we are to name someone a single person as responsible for this whole Mass it would be sheikina so the question is of accountability and the UN is also it appears demanding accountability because the UN rights Chief fatur has has called on Bangladesh to urgently disclose the details of last week's Crackdown calling for an impartial independent and transparent investigation let's just listen to what he had to say today I'm calling on the Bangladesh government urgently to disclose full details about last week's Crackdown on protests amid growing accounts of horrific violence latest reports indicate that more than 170 people have been killed and over a thousand injured some of whom were denied Medical Care and many are missing following protests by students and youth movements against government policies and the government is now saying that it set up an independent judicial committee to look at what happened during these protests and fix accountability Bish can one expect the government to investigate itself um that is the question uh that many protesters and many people in Bangladesh are asking because they do not trust the government of shikina and they do not trust an investigation under her government will be fair and transparent and Bish one reason is because um during these protests many people not only in Bangladesh but also worldwide saw uh the use of force and Power by the government of shikina and many of these videos are now making rounds on social media some of these videos have been verified as I've mentioned earlier by Amnesty International and we can even show our viewers uh one of the video that was uh authenticated and analyzed by Amnesty International in this video we can see student Abu s 25-year-old student who was studying at BAM rukaya University in Northwestern city of rangpur he's standing alone he's unarmed um he's just holding a stick um and then we see that police officers discharge 12 God's short guns directly uh towards him from across the street um and then so Amnesty International says that they used satellite imagery to geolocate the positioning of s and the police officers and they found that um they were at a distance of about 15 M during the shooting um so one one of uh when when he is hit his friends take him he collapses his friends take him uh to the hospital and Bish when he is brought to the hospital um he he was already the doctors say that but he was already brought debt at the hospital and amnesty International's investigation suggest that the pathologist who examined the photos of wounds of Abu um they were cons consistent with bird short wound and Amnesty International says that the use of birdshot which is basically a hunting weapon they consider it to be highly inappropriate uh while um uh highly it's they considered it's used to be highly inappropriate especially on protesters it can cause serious injuries and at times death tasim about this particular case has there been any comment from the Bangladesh government as to why the police felt compelled to uh to shoot at Abu Sayed no none no official comments I mean they just say they're going to investigate but the Judiciary is absolutely controlled by the executive branch of the government so uh we really don't know I what kind of independent uh investigation is possible under under these kind of mechanisms and on Abu s I'd like to add that there is another video in Daka which we have geolocated and authenticated where we can see that a uh protester who is injured and his friend is trying to rescue him and then a policeman actually comes and shoots that both of them point blank I mean the protester is not dead yet he's injured and his friend is trying to save them that person and after police Point Blank starts shooting at both of them uh the protester the injured protester dies and his friend actually has to run away I mean it's one of the most brutal things you don't even see these things in uh War zones uh that's that's the brutality uh that that that is being Meed out I just want to request uh viewers on on the live stream and on uh TV uh if you'd like to get involved send us your questions we're trying to uh look at the question of accountability when it comes to the uh actions of the Bangladeshi police and also the government so please send us specific questions to do with that b and tasim would be happy to take it up but Bish back to you because you've been following these protests for so long I believe you have also been able to uh uh find videos of uh uh security Personnel firing at uh at protesters is that correct I mean if you have those visuals maybe we can play that for our viewers and then U just discuss that yes um let's let's first have a watch uh let's have a let's watch this video where we use we receive a armed army officer um uh shooting and this video has also been verified by Amnesty International and here we see that an officer is firing an AK p assault rifle during the protests and and these rifles don't fire bird shot right I mean they fire either real ammunition or blanks is that correct yes I am not a weapons expert but this is what appears to be tasim uh you're probably looking at these uh images as well can you explain to us why Bangladeshi security Personnel felt compelled to fire at protesters were protesters so threatening well actually if you look at the we have seen other versions of the same video and we have seen photographs from the same scene we have identified that specific officer for legal reasons I'm not naming him right now here uh and we could see that he is actually shooting live bullets I mean obviously at uh protesters who were clearly you know running away from uh from the bgb from the border guards so he is shooting at people's back who are I mean who are at a distance of say like 500 M or 400 m uh that's difficult to uh determine from from those videos and photographs but those protesters were not in any way endangering uh the the bgb's security or anything and you know why exactly they were shooting uh like that why exactly that officer was shooting like that that he by the way actually served as a United Nation Peacekeeper before uh that is also something we are also discussing name is that confirmed uh which what what is confirmed that he that he served with the for the United Nations in a peacekeeping role he he he he he he served uh previously he served in a un mission that is confirmed and then he is also he also served in repoduction Battalion and uh I'm sure you are aware that do Val investigations and netro news and uh Z sa actually did a joint investigation where we highlighted this problem uh very in in in in detail so this whole thing is coming up again and again and uh is is connected to what What UN Human Rights is uh Chief is saying yeah and and this is something that is been picked up uh by those in the chat in our community as well uh let's bring up one of those questions when it comes to what the United Nations is potentially asking for this is a a question from Muhammad shif aah and he's asking and I quote has the UN taken any action for the military using un Vehicles against the peaceful student protesters do un rules permit this and he goes on to comment that a statement alone is not enough we need action this can I ask you to take that one please uh we have not seen any concrete action apart from boiler plate statements and that is also unfortunately like the moment uh we came to know that Army is being deployed I asked my team to send a uh query to the secretary General's office um trying to get a comment from them uh because I mean Bangladesh is one of the top uh troop contributing countries and we were asking them that there is this risk that un and his peacekeeping equipment might be used they chose not to reply to our query uh the UN secretary General's office and just one day later we see that un insignias on uh military uh armored personnel carriers and helicopters were being used and when uh un spokesperson was asked about this during a press conference he oh I mean this is unacceptable and that's it I all we have seen are these kind of uh statements and no concrete action which is very unfortunate why do you think there is reticence on the part of the un uh that is a question that can be best answered by the U but uh we understand that uh maybe they're uh hesitant because Bangladesh is a top uh troop contributing country maybe they're too much reliant on them right uh but that that is also a problem right because how can you have uh peacekeepers from a military and police uh that is killing its own civilian population to go and keep the peace and establish human rights in other uh War tone parts of the world wearing the UN helmet uh it doesn't make any sense let's take another question uh uh from uh the community on chat uh and this is a question to do with uh the the records of people who've been killed HF Leisure asking we know the police took death records from many hospitals do you have any information on this can I come to you again th name on this uh yes we have we have heard reports my own reporters on the ground have said that it is extremely difficult and in some places I mean the very first day uh one of our special correspondence with the was at the Daka uh Medical College Hospital uh he could uh see the death register and the admittance register for a few hours and after that he just called me and said well we cannot uh check the register anymore because a group of people came in and just tore out the pages so the de register at the emergency world uh does not exist anymore I mean that is from my own Cor respondent on the ground I'm I'm I don't have confirmations from other hospitals but taka Medical College Hospital emergency word I I can confirm right so that is that that would appear if if that is indeed true that the government was trying to potentially cover up um evidence and you were also trying to sort of uh speak to protesters Bish as to what it is that they experienced and I think you managed to speak to and track down one of the student protesters who was explaining uh uh how the government was cracking down against him and other protesters and exactly what the government did to him right I did speak to some protesters and actually one of the main protest coordinators ASF mhmood uh I spoke to him the last I spoke to him was on 18th July and we did broadcast uh his uh his video that he had sent me B when he was hiding from the police arrest and he had told me at that time um that while he was recording this video he was getting a report that student protesters were being shot at and that he he he really worried that he would be either abducted or arrested um and from after 18 his name is ASF Mahmud and after 18th July I there was internet shutdown uh but I tried several times I was not able to connect with him and now his video has appeared he has um sent a video from an undisclosed location to Reuters um and he basically says that he was uh given administered sedatives and he was abused and tortured while he was in custody H and what did he say about why he believes that the state or he according to him the state did it uh let's have a listen to what he said I think they took us away to keep us from making decisions about our movement while they massacred all those people they made some of us disappear some were beaten we were pressured to stop the movement so uh B uh they say that and it's not only Asif Mahmud nahidul Islam also one of the main protest organizers he also claims that he was abducted and what they say is that the government didn't want them to mobilize people didn't want them uh to strategize the protest movement and therefore uh they really came hard on the protest organizers and there are also reports now now that many people still um are missing and and they don't know like there are no we don't know anything about them how many people are still missing do we have we don't have a we don't have a figure but there these protest organizers and protesters claim that still there are some people that they have no idea where they are I just want to bring in a few comments that are being made in our chat uh by people uh people are are are talking about uh demanding an independent uh uh un investigation uh there are demands such as from USA Salam and Sons Steel saying step down uh shik Hina U and then uh there are questions about whether Killers can play the role of peacekeepers that from Muhammad Abu tah but tasim if I can just put to you something that um a minister of the government has said this is from Muhammad Ali arafath who's Junior Minister for information and broadcasting of Bangladesh he was speaking to me uh uh sometime back and he said and I quote we can sense an invasion of a third party who got into it and started attacking the government establishment is this an attempt by the government to delegitimize the students and say that the students aren't behind this but some other third party and if so why well thank you Bish that's a very good question and you know it's very easy to debunk I mean we look at the dead bodies we some of the I mean many of those we have identified I would say 90% of them sorry I'm just putting a percentage there but like most of them are young students and my team uh initially compiled a list where we could see like uh most of the Dead were 17 to 22 year old University students without any kind of political affiliation so if any third party is involved as the government is claiming who are they and why they are not dying why the Bangladesh government and its security agencies are killing innocent students peaceful protesters uh we can also talk about I mean we have seen uh the video right you you you have just shown that and amnesty evidence lab has authenticated that and that was a university student who was unarmed not posing any immediate threat to the police officers shot multiple times uh with a with a uh 12 God shotgun uh and and how do they explain that who who is the third party here on in the video we just see two parties I mean unarmed protesters and the State shooting at him and G also uh the fact that that the they blame the opposition the opposition itself says that they have also been facing State oppression halah is critically ill her son is in Exile so it it is difficult to really comprehend that is the opposition that powerful that they can really trigger such a massive scale of protests let's go back to the government because there are there are questions that are being raised uh in in the chat about the fate of shik Hina let's just take two questions uh this one from USA sadii who is asking what do you think will prime minister Hina steep down after uh this protest and let's take another question on the on the on the same theme this one from uh you are tired of everything asking can we take shik Hina to the international Court we need to know I'm just going to direct both those questions to you the name if you would like to take them on uh I don't see any way out of this crisis uh where shiken uh does not I step down or she is replaced in some other way I mean this is something I feel uh has completely gone out of hand and in order to have a stable uh Bangladesh uh which is not a threat to International Peace and security sheikina needs to go because after killing more than 200 00 actually at at the last count uh protesters like this most of them students a government uh absolutely lost his legitimacy and I don't see how shikina can survive this as the prime minister of Bangladesh um regarding the question about uh International Court I know that there have been uh some movements from activist groups and academics to uh bring this to the international uh Criminal Court uh Preparatory work uh is being done but that will depend on the prosecutor of the court I mean as you know individuals cannot bring cases it has to be either the prosecutor or a state party that will refer the case um or the security Council which is highly unlikely but I think you mentioned something about u a un Commission of inquiry uh we at netro news we have already published a leader calling for it and I think that is the first and immediate uh step the International Community can take uh in order to have some accountability uh for for for these crimes can I can I just uh go back to what you said earlier saying that there you see no other way other than shik H stepping down because things have gone past the point of uh no return presumably I wonder how you make that assertion given that the US in your words is not really uh coming out very strongly against the government at the moment and as Bish just said the opposition BNP the Bangladesh national party is itself virtually in tus because a lot of its members have been arrested or they are facing cases so who takes over what really is the pressure uh for shik Hina uh that would force her to step down well Shena is obviously under level of pressure from her own people we are not talking about pressure from the United Nation the pressure here is that the general public of Bangladesh uh they are so angry at her government that in order to control the civil unrest sheikina has to impose curfew and deploy the military and even then the situation is not necessarily under control I mean even last night there were nighttime raids uh in different neighborhoods of taka and hundreds have been arrested uh just last night I mean in the in the past few days we know that thousands have been arrested uh more than 10 10,000 people have been uh injured according to a western diplomatic Source Who who was speaking to us so this whole country is breaking down and that is the pressure and as I say like when when a state like that breaks down uh it is a effect to International Peace and security and the International Community has the responsibility to protect the civilians let's bring in let's bring in another question that has uh come out in the chat being asked by a member of the community this is to do with uh again uh responses from International leaders specific question from Hazard uh who's asking why are Germany and other International leaders and Western countries is remaining silent why haven't they taken any action against the dictator aena are they silent because they benefit from this uh let's just bring that to you uh Bish this is a very interesting question and um I have seen a lot of comments on social media from analysts from General people who are saying if this same thing had happened in a country like Iran where 170 people were killed by Iranian State what would the reaction would be of the western world and I think it's a legitimate question um and maybe the answer behind is that shik Hina does enjoy uh a lot of support from her allies uh in the region if we talk that she enjoys uh strong support from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi she's very close to uh the uh to prime minister Narendra Modi and this is also one of the reasons as name has mentioned that there is now anger among the people this is one reason why we do see an increasing anti-india sentiment uh in Bangladesh India is a very close Ally of the US in the Indo Pacific and therefore some analysts say that sh kazina enjoys desid support of the US Administration in the region uh she's also now very closely working with powers like Russia powers like China who don't care what's happening domestically in a country they want just want to deal uh with a powerful government and therefore the outrage is basically coming from people we see people uh in uh in in Pakistan people students in India and other parts of the world supporting uh or or expressing their solidarity with the bangl Bangladeshi students not So Much from the world leaders there have been protest in in India already by students in Kolkata for example let's just take an another question from the community This concerns whether Bangladesh could be sanctioned this is from user finway I hope I'm pronouncing that right uh who's asking do you think the Bangladeshi government finally deserves to be sanctioned by the UN and European Union because those condemnations and statements by them are not working for years now I'll come to you tasim with this just based on what Bish was saying does the geopolitics of the time favor shik Hina and maybe that's why these sanctions maybe will not happen it's a very good question and there are also some economic interest involved what we have seen very recently uh this is a bit anecdotal uh the government uh in the in the last few days actually arranged a propaganda tour against different government facilities that were uh destroyed uh during the protest and was creating immense level of pressure on diplomat to join these government managed tools which reminds me of how Bashar al- Assad used to like arrange the such such media tours in in in Syria and many of the western embassies actually boycotted the tour but some of the western embassies including the French for example uh joined the tour and land their uh you know credibility and legitimacy uh behind uh such a government propaganda effort and one of the key reasons is that France is actually trying to sell their airplanes for example to to to Bangladesh so economic interests are also very important here uh I mean they are trying to sell Airbus and Raphael and whatnot uh and as we know Bangladesh is a one of the biggest exporters of readymade garments to Europe uh so yes I mean we know the labor situation in Bangladesh is also uh ter terrible and some of the protesters are actually uh RMG workers so yes I mean sanctions right now would be a good idea and a very good deterrent uh that could have helped Bangladesh government change its Behavior Uh but I really don't see that coming uh United Nations that's another question uh I mean we have sort of touched up uh that already right for for viewers who are just joining us we are talking about the situation in uh uh Bangladesh and that's why we have this program asdw which will which allows you to ask us your questions and send us your comments all you need to do is go to our YouTube page DW news and there you will find this live stream and in the chat function on the site please feel free to send us uh your comments to be honest there are a number of comments it's it's uh I'm finding it very hard to keep up with them but then the general sentiment in in the in the in the chat appears to be that people are demanding an either an independent investigation from the United Nations or demanding that prime minister shik hassa stepped down and lots of cries of save Bangladesh that's what's happening currently in the chat but let's just go back uh to the beginning and uh why and look at why this uh these uh these protests and the situation in Bangladesh nearly went out of hand beish you've been following these protests and you've also been speaking to a number of protesters what is often overlooked is that many women and girl students were also taking part uh in these protests and I think you managed to speak to one of them about who was sharing her experiences being in these protests yes um B what was interesting during these protests was that a lot of female students uh and uh female students were also protesting and what is interesting is that they were also protesting against quota government job quotas that are that were for women so we know that these protests started basically because the students were contesting were arguing uh job government job quas and we saw that among male students there were a lot of female students who were also uh uh Angry and demonstrating and protesting against these government job quas which also had a 10% qua for women and um these women protesters and also Amnesty International says that the women protesters were also brutally direct uh brutally Target get it um and we spoke with one of the female protester uh who got injured by uh a prover student body Bangladesh chra league and we can talk about that later but let's first have a listen to what she had to say if I share my name or my institution's name anyone can come to my house at midnight and just arrest me without any warrant or anything because they have that power and we stood stents we have no power for us the last few days were just nightmares it still feels like a nightmare I was attacked with cocktails by the BCL Bangladesh chatu league and the police force of the government it left me shaken and injured in front of my eyes a mother and her child were brutally shot and killed a scene that will haunt me forever I mean that that testimony is just I don't know it's just hard to listen to I think it must be even harder for somebody who's actually seen that to get over it but uh this this female protester did talk about the Bangladesh chatro league and I know that you've been researching the Bangladesh chatro league as well what exactly is it and how is it involved in these protests um it's a pro government student body and some of the students have told me that um they there are adult grown men who are a part of this student body so they never uh they never graduate or they keep themsel registered as students and it's not only the police or the Armed Forces of Bangladesh that were involved in the Crackdown um there there are uh reports by Amnesty International eyewitnesses have told them that there were directed assaults by Bangladesh chatra League at students and they didn't discriminate between m male students and female students they targeted everyone uh in the even even in many news agencies have reported uh women protesters have told that they they attacked them uh they sexually harassed them they attacked them um uh especially uh targeting their head so there are a lot of wounds head wounds uh among female protesters um and the students now the student body uh the student protesters are demanding that this Bangladesh chra League should be banned from student politics uh Tas can you bring us a bit more background on the Bangladesh chatra League how did it get involved in the protest this is not the first time they've been involved in protest have they no I mean they have a long history of terrorizing and killing and also being involved in Petty crimes uh including stealing goats uh I mean for some reason uh from from different parts of the country so it's a it's a criminal organization in so many ways uh the closest example from history I can remember would be uh Hitler Youth in Nazi Germany uh but but chhat leag probably is more brutal than that and they have been attacking and terrorizing uh you know regular students at all University and college campuses for years right now and that is why there is a growing demand from uh the general eneral students that chatra league needs to be banned and labeled a terrorist organization and uh I mean initially in the first few days of the protest we actually saw uh General students forcing chatra League leaders uh out of this uh dormitor student dormitories where they used to like uh leave like kings and queens so and and now now we don't know what's what's going to the future for this organization T I do need to ask you you just said that the chatro league is more brutal than the Hitler Youth is that an extreme classification I wish it was an extreme classification I said that is the closest I can come up with because chatra League I'm trying to making your uh make your viewers in Germany understand what we are talking about but I would say chatra league is more brutal they the they're the strong Troopers of of the army League party and and Shaka okay okay we we'll leave that uh uh as as an opinion but I'm not entirely sure that that might be factually correct but let's let's let's park that to the side and take a question uh from uh the the the community uh here is a question from Anar Hussein who is now asking even now Hina is only talking about damaged property not a single word about murdered or arrested students uh Bish is that factually correct she's not said anything about uh the students so basically what we say that government is maybe trying to do damage control they're trying to build narrative they took reporters and journalists to uh the burn down building of uh uh um the state broadcaster of Bangladesh so they are showing to the world that the protests were very violent were very brutal and that a third party as you have mentioned which basically they say the opposition and that they uh instigated the protest leaders and it is basically they are they are to be blamed um and they created such a big loss for the for the government of uh Bangladesh so much of loss of property so much of damage of infrastructure this is the narrative that they are trying to build and what the students are saying that don't forget us that we most of the people who have been killed are uh are the students so instead of the government um uh uh uh trying to talk about the Crackdown and the killings they're trying to build a narrative around the damage that has been done uh in Bangladesh very very mild statements have uh uh come out of uh of the government of Bangladesh um sympathetic towards the killings of of these protesters the the the the community uh on chat is also commenting uh regularly the the the comments are moving too fast for me to to name check any one particular uh individual but then people are talking about shik Hina uh resigning there there's talk about uh the UN getting involved somebody calling Sheik Hina dictator Hina I apologize I cannot name check everybody because the comments are flying through the uh the chat uh rather quickly uh tasim if I can just uh come to you based on uh the the the the plight of the students at the moment it appears it is only the students who are speaking for themselves there is nobody else to speak for them would that be a fair assessment yeah they are I mean absolutely smart and uh I mean modern uh gen Z kids and they do uh on their own issues and they do speak for themselves and they don't need any external uh representatives to either speak for them or tell them what to do and that is exactly uh why the government is not able to really uh crush them let's let's bring in a a a question from a user on the chat about this very thing karolina Vena asking is it possible to have a public forum between the government and students to resolve this unrest and uh violence Bish has there been any any movement towards both sides talking so initially when the protest begin the students say that we were holding peaceful protests against government job quas that was their main demand and at one point there was a talk even from the government side they were saying at least publicly they were saying that you know we will have a dialogue we will negotiate with the students students were also saying the same but bires what the Crackdown has done and what these thousands and thousands of injured students uh and and more than 150 people killed what that has done that has now the anger the students so much that they say they will not negotiate they will not talk with the government unless and they've put very hard and strict like demands unless they are not fulfilled they see that the the time for negotiation and talk has gone uh they need Justice For What has uh happened in the country T are we at a deadlock because um if I if I remember correctly students have put forward a list of nine demands for the for the government to meet and given that they're not to each other where are we with those demands is it a state of Deadlock then it is at a state of Deadlock and you cannot have a uh you cannot have a dialogue with a party that is killing you and that is exactly what the students are saying that we would have uh had a dialogue with the government uh I mean as long as they peacefully negotiated with us instead they unleash the chhat league on University campuses and later unleash the the uh police and the Border guards and also we have seen reports of uh protest leaders like nahidul Islam and uh Asif uh being uh abducted and taken to uh some facility and tortured also injected with some some kind of chemicals um you cannot I mean when when the government is uh abusing the students and it's uh the protest leaders like this uh I think uh I mean dialogue is out of question and right now yes it is at a dialogue I mean the deadlock the students have uh very clear demands shikina needs to apologize take responsibility for the killings uh some of the ministers need to be uh either fired or they need to step down uh police officers uh with command responsibility over the killings need to be fired I mean these are very logical uh demands which anyone would agree with and the government I don't think is going to accept any of them Ju Just so be clear uh what we're talking about here is how the government has handled these protests and reporter B ja has been monitoring the government's actions and how these protests have been playing out over the past few days if Bish you have also been able to if I'm not wrong access a video that shows uh how security forces were dealing with a protester uh during those protests can you tell us a bit more about what this video is and uh what we potentially going to see yeah abish this was one of the um a very graphic videos and it was really difficult to watch we will only show a part of this video which was also verified by Amnesty International and if we could play that video um in that video we see an unconscious student Sheikh ashid Yamin he was a student at the Military Institute of Sciences and technology in an area known as Savar near Daka um so what we see that he's unconscious he's injured and he's left um uh there uh the security forces do not make an effort to take him to the hospital and B Amnesty International says that according to the international law um the law enforcement agencies were supposed to provide him help and medical assistance and he was left alone later he he was still alive later that day um he he he he he was he died what your basically saying is that if the security Personnel who were there on that road next to him lying on the road if they had provided timely Medical Aid if they had intervened he would still be alive today of course we can I mean this is this is something that the that will continue to haunt the family of of this student what if he had been given medical assistance in time he may have survived of course the truth we'll never know but he was life at that point and medical assistance was not provided to him uh let's let's take a question uh particularly on these these graphic uh uh videos like we just saw well not not all of it was graphic but this is a question from Miss misanthrop who is uh saying there are now many videos of the brutality being shared on social media local media is not showing them when will International media like DW show these images I think this is one for you pish because the video that we were seeing it is far more graphic than what we have just shown could you explain to us uh what we decide what is the methodology we use to determine whether we show certain videos which videos we show which videos we don't show so it was a difficult decision for us uh because there are some videos that are that are very very difficult that are sensitive that can hurt a lot of people if we show them the way they are and therefore especially the last video that we we showed we had to cut parts of it because it was so difficult to watch an unconscious student and people around him like security people around him not offering any help or any sympathy or any empathy to a human being uh and therefore but I do think that DW we are doing a like at least we are trying to show to the people what has happened in this country and we are also trying to speak to the government and also trying to put their point of view um that this needs to be investigated um um and I I think as as we trying to be responsible in how we report um the incidents that have happened in Bangladesh can you talk a bit more about how you went about verifying these videos I know that you've been having conversation with protesters as well can you talk through a bit about that process how have you been uh going about looking at these videos and verifying them so um it's it's it's quite a process and therefore we he relied on um independent Rights group Amnesty International and they have used different terminologies for example they us GE location they used satellite imagery they use um uh signboards uh the location what they and different ways to assess the authentic authenticity the date uh of the visuals and for example in one of the videos we say they had they even assess the distance between uh police officer and the student abua uh so uh uh amnesty International's evidence lab uh has for now um authenticated and analyzed four videos and some of which we did uh show to our audiences uh but you've also been speaking uh to to students right I mean you've uh been in constant uh touch with them and you've been uh they've been assisting you as well yeah so I uh I get I have received so many messages from Bangladeshi students uh and many of them Bish from out outside of Bangladesh because of Internet shutdown it's so difficult uh for people to connect but when we started uh um um covering this uh these protests I received a lot of messages and I on my phone I receive videos of course I can't verify them so we I we have not chosen those videos but some of them are also uh very very brutal there's one video for example in which the there are people in a building in a house and they are shooting they are just making a video from their camera that just shows that the police is uh uh marching um on the street and when the when the I'm not even sure if it's police or the Armed Forces but when they see them filming they direct Point Blank shot at them and then the student goes behind like this of course we have not I don't I can't verify that's why we have not shown these videos um but B 15 million bangladeshis live outside of Bangladesh and for five days at least for 5 days they were completely cut off from their country from their relatives uh from their loved ones because of Internet shutdown and even though now uh um the internet connectivity is uh is back uh telecommunication servic is back it's very very limited even today it's very difficult to call somebody in Bangladesh and just to have a to speak with them there it seems like even now despite curfew being lifted or despite uh the internet service being back there is a lot of restriction let's just look at that internet shutdown and uh there is a question that has come from the community uh based on that let's just let's just take that uh on on our screens now uh that is from Sonia 2.0 who is asking why did the government shut down the mobile internet in Bangladesh tasim would you like to take that on please well shutting down the internet uh Countrywide or region wide is uh not a new thing we have seen that in South Asia uh before uh Kashmir in Indian occupied Kashmir is an example where whenever the government decides to crack down on the population they shut down the internet and disconnect the whole region uh from the rest of the world what has happened in Bangladesh is pretty much uh the same thing uh there are two things uh that uh might be behind this one is the uh law enforcement agency is want to stop the protesters from coordinating uh amongst each other uh specifically through mobile internet that is one and another is they don't really want the world to know what is happening because if you have open internet and if you are connected to the rest of the world uh the video that we' saw uh watched uh at at the beginning of the show um the the the protester being killed I me those kind of material actually just spreads like wildfire uh inside and outside the country so they wanted to uh most likely to to uh preempt that kind of situation but it also had another um side effect to that isn't it Bish because as you were saying a lot of people who live outside the country could not get in touch with their loved ones for a long time yes and I think it's it for me it's a very heartbreaking story because yes the them is absolutely right that the government of India did had an internet shutdown in in in Kashmir also during elections I was in Pakistan when I was covering election mobile internet was completely cut off for one day but the entire country of 170 million people with no internet connectivity no telecommunication service for 5 days uh is is is just unbelievable um and so many people so many messages that we got were that people were so worried about what was happening with their family members many people were not able to send REM remittances to their families during these 5 days with with the like complete country basically cut off from the entire world with this being the situation within Bangladesh many people in the in the chat from our community are asking whether uh outside pressure will uh should be brought to bear let's just take a few uh questions uh on on that front on your screen now this is from mukit Hassan who's asking how can International leaders and organizations apply pressure on prime minister sh K's government to stop the violence against protesters and uphold Democratic uh principles um and let's take another question of the back of that as well uh this is from MD shovon who was asking why do Western countries always follow double standards how many lives do we have to sacrifice to get the world's attention theim are we seeing double standards from the West here of course we are seeing double standard from the West here and uh responding to the first question I mean if for example the European Union I I am a European citizen I am a Swedish Citizen and I am ashamed of the way U European Union has responded uh to this crisis if the Western governments wanted to solve this uh crisis and stand with the people of Bangladesh they could do have done it yesterday and they have just chosen not to do anything apart from maybe periodically issuing uh boiler plate statements uh so yeah we do see double standards and I think Bish was uh talking about this comparison between Iran and Bangladesh right we saw masa amini for example who was killed during the Iran protest and that snowballed into this whole whole crisis for the regime there Abu s is the Bangladeshi version of masam in in Iran and see how the European Union or the parliament has responded to the Iranian crisis trying to uh Express solidarity with the protesters imposing sanctions and and and lots of other coercive measures and diplomatic measures as well uh on the other hand in in in Bangladesh some of the European ambassadors are actually actively particip ipating in propaganda media tours so yes double standard of course double standards Bish is that the sentiment that students also have you've been talking to lots of them yes um and I think it's a general sentiment I would say in many parts of the world um uh like this is a sentiment that I think now many people in global South are are are experiencing that they are angry and mad um at when the Western leaders and Western Powers who have the power um don't express solidarity um with um people who actually come from a very different part of the world maybe that situation changes and just to sort of bring people up to speed the there's lots of comments coming on the chat and we very thankful that you're sending us those comments I unfortunately as I was saying early I cannot name check everybody but the sentiment appears to be that people would like shik Hina to step down and they would also like an international independent International inquiry into what happened uh in Bangladesh but that's about all uh we have time for today I'd like to thank you uh Bish and tasim KH tasim just before we go what do you think we are going to see in Bangladesh in the next few days or the next few weeks would you like to gaze into your crystal ball uh no crystal ball gazing here what I know know from by talking to some of the protesters they are trying to reorganize they're trying to uh relaunch the movement already uh they have um um observed some religious programs today and we are waiting for them uh to declare their next set of pro uh programs in the next few hours actually so we'll see how how they uh engage with the government from here and how the government actually keeps its uh responses well leave it there for the moment tasim Khalil thank you so much for joining us from Malmo in in Sweden tasim khil editorinchief of NRA news which has conducted many investigations in Bangladesh including a joint investigation with DW news thanks so much for joining us and Bin jaave thanks so much for being in the studio and for bringing us that that wealth of

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'EtsbdwVE_1s'}, page_content=\"[Music] Al jazer podcasts today what sparked the deadly student protests in Bangladesh literally the whole city is paralyzed is very tense from the violence from several universities across the country Why students are losing faith in their country's promise of Independence and democracy I'm and this is the [Music] take I'm zul Saran I'm investigative journalist with Al investigative unit and I originally come from Bangladesh so sire welcome to the take it's good to have you we are talking on Friday July 19th and you're in touch with people in Bangladesh is much as you can be though the connections have been on and off telecommunications were widely disrupted amid violent student protests against quotas for government jobs looking at the pictures from daaka the capital there seem to be armored vehicles in the streets clouds of tear gas Riot police can you tell me what you've been hearing from people who are there about what's happening I had the opportunity to talk to one of my ex-teachers and he's nearly 70 years old he said that in his life he has not seen anything like this in Bangladesh before since the war of independence of 1971 so he is saying that we are living in a warlike [Music] [Applause] situation it's bullets are being fired shots are being fired right and left there is screams of people coming from the streets there are armored vehicles apcs patrolling the streets there are police helicopters circling and then there are he even say that they're shooting at people from the helicopters they're shooting rounds of tear gases wow oh my gosh so let's go back to when July 17th that's when Bangladesh started shutting down Public University campuses indefinitely right as a response to these protests talk to me about the protesters who are these students who are leading the demonstrations and what are they calling for the students their ask was a Reformation of the Koda system which has been in place for a long long time since they were independent and the Cota system it gives 30 % government jobs to relatives and families of the freedom fighters who fought in the Liberation war of 1971 and their ask is since it's been 53 years Bangladesh is liberated families of Freedom Fighters have already grown up enough so the jobs which are offered to the grandchildren or great grandchildren of the Freedom Fighters and they feel that this is not right because there are meritorious talented students out there who are missing out and also we have hundreds of thousands of graduates who doesn't have a proper job so the students basically are demanding to abolish or reform the scoda system and they were doing it peacefully mhm but all hell broke loose when the Prime Minister shikina commented something very derogatory uh during a press conference the way the rajak cars oppress this country I was very saddened to hear yesterday that in Roy Kaaya Hall even students calling themselves Raja cars do they know what happened there on the 25th of March 1971 Nar razakar is a town which is considered offensive in in because razakar of the people who collaborated with the Pakistan troops back in 1971 the night University students they all came to the streets they demonstrated and then following that day things started to deteriorate students were killed by police bullets and multiple were injured and along with the police there were the student with of the ruling party chat League there were in the streets with makeshift weapons like machetes swords this kind of stuff [Music] wow okay so the students are calling for the end of this quota system for government jobs because government jobs are highly coveted based on benefits and pay and stability shik hassina the Prime Minister came out and asked if these job should be allocated to what's known as the collaborator so she used this derogatory term to describe those who cited with Pakistan in 1971 correct yes so what do the students want the quota system to be replaced by they do not want the Kota system and if there is a k system they want to reform in the Kota system but what happened was in 2018 there was a similar student protest and then the prim Minister came out she say we're going to abolish the Kota system their own B Cota system Hina announced today that her government will abolish all quota privileges in the public service but after that some of the families of Freedom Fighters approached the high court of Bangladesh and turned down the instruction of the Prime Minister which was pretty strange because in Bangladesh you just don't turn down shik's decision so and and it was understood that she had some role in it because she controls the Judiciary and everything in the country H so what you're saying is that in 2018 these student protests which were similar but not as big they worked they got the prime minister to agree that there should not be a quota system anymore but that changed when Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision I feel like an important point to mention is that she has a connection of course her father yeah was the founding father of Bangladesh absolutely mujab Raman the leader of East Pakistan declared the region an independent republic he was seen as a man he considered the leader who was a torch beer for our independence war and people acknowledge that and people respect that but she have overbed it and what you are seeing right now it has all like kind of collapsed because the students now they're demanding that the government must quit shik must step down M wow it sounds like the youth in Bangladesh are disappointed by what their parents and grandparents fight for independence has ultimately led to yes they are massively disappointed and what happened is now they are being joined by the general people who have been oppressed all these years and again if you look back there are three National elections and as they have stuffed all organizations with their own people all the elections happened under their Administration so the people had no opportunity to cause their votes MH in the election since last 14 15 years [Music] wow so that is the background and the context for what we're seeing s and we know that prime minister shik Hina was just reelected in January and these protests are clearly a challenge to her Administration so she spoke on Wednesday and promised that there would be a Judicial panel to investigate the deaths in these protests and she promised that those responsible would be brought to Justice I further declare that there will be judicial investigation into all unintended incidents including murders with fairness and Justice what do protesters make of that well during her rule she has been in the Helm of power we have seen these things we have seen one of the biggest catastroph of in the garments industry happened during her rule in 2013 there has been another horrific incident at a garment Factory in Bangladesh an 8-story building collapsed today killing at least 14 people and injuring hundreds of others there were fires where garment workers were charged to death inside their factories and all these were owned by the government party people or people who were close to the government we have not seen any exemplary punishment the corruption in the country have gone H and there is no accountability in nothing and what we are observing now what is happening right now is just the Outburst of all these things you know like when your back is at the wall you either give up or you push back so I think now they're in the pushing back [Music] state after the break what it's like to be a journalist reporting on these protests in Bangladesh [Music] so sat when you talk about corruption it's because you have personal reporting experience on what you have found with the government of prime minister Sheik Hina you are an investigative journalists and you've published reporting that revealed corruption at very high levels in Bangladesh's government and you have faced retaliation for that you and your family members what are you hearing from journalists now who were there about the challenges and Reporting on these protests the media landscape in Bangladesh is again one strange Dynamics I can tell you like press freedom in the country is nonexistent it's like a military it's like dictatorial state so even if you draw a cartoon even if you criticize the prime minister or her family you will end up in jail so you know like journalists have been reporting the people still their journalist I have many journalist friends in Bangladesh who have been struggling to report during this protest there are hundreds of journalists are in the field but they are also injured because like when the police are firing when the police are biding people and government thugs are beating people they are indiscriminate they do not see who is a journalist who is a student or whatever so one journalist have actually died yesterday while reporting from the field for a daily called Daka times he lost his life a very good friend of mine mtad Rashid Romeo who works for an outlet called banga Outlook got shot at his hand so people I know are getting injured they taking their hit and sadly we don't like we don't really have much safety for the journalist in in madesh there are few journalists like me who are abroad so we have multiple sources in the military in inell agencies in various sectors and they keep on feeding us the information so the information which normally would not go to public in Bangladesh we receive it and we have been releasing it and I think sensing this the government have totally blacked out the country cuz they doesn't want the world to know what is happening in Bangladesh right now finally s thinking of the Telecommunications blackout cutting Bang off from the rest of the world these deadly clashes between protesters and armed forces and police and the deaths where do you think this protest movement and the Crackdown and response from the government goes from here what do you for see happening next since we're talking right now like I can tell you just recently there was a prison breakout like during the protest the protesters attacked the prison and the n district and hundreds of prisoners have escaped from the prison they set the prison to fire wow they have set the state television station they have set it to fire they have set fire to multiple police stations they have set fire to Ministry and various government party ruling party offices across the country and these are protesters these are protesters protesters and general people and it is likely to be escalated from here and cutting off Bangladesh from rest of the world is a very foolish decision because you know like it is a country of 170 million people it's a massive country we have around 15 million bangladeshis living abroad all of them they send reminisces back to Bangladesh their families and remance has significant impact on Bangladesh's economy so what they're doing what the government is doing now they have kind of created a like blockade from these experts to communicating with their family members who are living in Bangladesh and how can you do this it simply just doesn't make any sense but it shows the brutality of the regime of shik the brutal mindset of shik that she won't leave any stone unturned to remain in the power so far nearly hundreds of people have lost their lives and their demand now as we hear that the demand is for shakas will step down if he doesn't step down if you want to continue like this days ahead are going to be very bad for Bangladesh and that's the take this

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'iQJ7EPxvTLY'}, page_content=\"always Bangladesh has seen some of its worst violence in decades sparked by student protests against a government job quota system the demonstrators say favored supporters of the ruling aami League party the country Supreme Court has now scrap the quota but with dozens killed and hundreds arrested serious questions remain over the government's handl of the crisis with students demanding meaningful change in a country where they believe Democratic Values are at risk join us over the next half an hour as Muhammad Arafat Bangladesh's minister of State for information and broadcasting talks to Al jaer Muhammad Arafat welcome to talk to aljazera so it's 2 weeks since the protest started against a government job quota system at least 150 people are reported dead although the government has not released official figures the country has been crippled by internet and Communications blackouts as you try to control the unrest what is it that you would like to tell us as a member of Bangladesh's government about its handling of this crisis uh thank you very much for your question uh first of all the government is still determining the exact number once uh the number is is determined and double checked and they will definitely the government will declare uh the number of deceased people about the internet well actually in the very beginning before July 18 uh in some of the places few very few places uh temporarily the internet was shut down because uh there were lots of rumors going around which was adding uh fuel to the fire because uh tensions were pretty high the uh there were lots of uh clashes broke out and government's intention was to restore Peace So for the security reason government did that but that was done temporarily and only few places but on July 18th onward what happened is uh the miscreant they actually uh you know Set Fire to the data center and uh also the fiber optics Cable in many parts of the country and therefore the whole thing got shut down and the government was trying to restore it back but they kept on finding some damage somewhere and it took us like like 3 to 4 days to bring it back now we are back on data again and and the internet is back uh you refer to many of the protesters those involved in demonstrating and indeed a number of those who were killed as quote miscreants there I I wonder how soon you will be clear about the exact number of civilians killed here why can't you know that number right now what is the issue here the number of uh people got killed injured it needs to be determined and when the government is going to give the number that has to be absolutely accurate therefore uh government has to work on that very uh you know carefully and you know that from yesterday onward only the office started working before that uh there was uh you know no you know it was officially uh closed everything because we were kind of dealing with the war war type situation in Bangladesh and uh and uh when it comes to the casualties injuries and deaths were not uh willing to discriminate between the police and uh uh General people or the protesters or the people from the supporters of the government every single debts are uh uh uh you know equally important to us we denounce all of the deaths and we expressed our deep condolences to the family members uh those who lost their lives and we are we have already formed a Judicial independent judicial committee uh to make sure that a thorough investigation is done so that everyone responsible for any of these casualties uh can be brought to book that is the commitment of the government but let me also give you a perspective here what the country went through we also witnessed the first ever jailbreak that is uh by no way can be considered as a protest or something the anarchist they descended on the Ning the jail prison and they leading to uh the escape the 826 prisoners including nine High level jihadist those who were captured there and the attackers they also looted the Firearms the ammunitions and all that and took 160 prison staff to hostage but to call a very very large student body miscreant uh do you think that that is in any way distorting the reality of the situation of course people were out on mass to protest against this very unpopular job quota uh regulation first of all the government uh you know issued a circular in 2018 abolishing quota fully so students were happy about it so what happened is later on in 2014 this year and on June 5th High Court cancelled that government circular so the Kota came back again that's when the students started protesting so at the same time the government challenged the Judgment of the high court to in the appell division of the Supreme Court and our position on the quota and the students demand were on the same page there was no difference so we kept we repeatedly appealed to the students that if there's a judgment coming out of the high court that cannot be changed in the street by demonstrating so we went to the appell division and Challen challenging that judgment so that we can restore back the circular that was issued by the government back in 2018 something which was the demand of the students too so we told them why don't you come and join us attached your attach your lawyer in the court and let us do it together in the court so we kept on telling them to be patient let us do it through the judicial process so our position and their position were totally on the same page but still they went ahead with this protest and they wanted us to make a declaration that we're going to have to uh form a commission so that uh we can reform the quara then we said when it is a Subud this matter then government cannot officially make any declaration because that's going to be constitutional but the reason why that quota system was reinstated was because uh families and Veterans of those involved in the independence struggle requested it are those people who requested the repeal of this law not uh supporters of your political party yes what high court did is based on uh an application from another group of people so they you know filed a read petition and based on that the high court gave the Jud judgement but we from the government did not agree to that Judgment of cancelling that circular in 2018 that's why that's why we challenged that judgment to the Appel Division and we're making an argument in the Supreme Court that the 2018 circula should uh be restored back meaning our position and the demand of the students were the same so we asked the students that instead of blocking the roads instead of creating more sufferings of the the people of their movement it's better that you be patient let us all do it together in the judicial process and prime minister also said that see in the meantime what happened the clashes broke out in some places and some people got killed six people got killed then after that the Prime Minister appeared on the national television and she expressed her deep condolences she denounced it and she also made the Declaration that we are going to investigate each one of them and then she again appealed to the students that please be patient let us you are not going to be hopeless we you will be your demand will be satisfied through the judicial process we're trying our best to do it we're fighting your cause in the appell division in the Supreme Court well I mean they would argue that it hasn't happened soon enough let mean let me just repeat exactly what has happened in the last uh uh week or so because of course you mentioned it started with these student protests against the job quota system where 30% of jobs were originally reserved for veterans of the war of indep dependents and their close relatives in light now of these protests the Supreme Court has slashed that to 5% with 2% for ethnic minorities and those with disability so in theory 93% of jobs now should be given to people on Merit is that how you see it 93% of jobs in Bangladesh should go to people who simply deserve it yes do you then accept that the yes 93% will go to the Merit so you are in a agreement that the quota system unfairly benefited those close to the ruling aami League party which of course was founded by those who fought the independence war that is the argument that the protesters are making that is not correct because let me tell you this on 2018 when the circular was issued to abolish the Cota if you take a data preceding 5 years when the quota was there then you can look at this out of the 30% % of the Freedom Fighters quota how many people was recruited what percentage of the people fall into that category were recruited it was only 8% it was never filled because the the way it was it it is it works is first you have to apply for the preliminary exam it's more than 100,000 people apply for it then it then some people pass through it then you have to apply for the written exam and after that it you know you short list it that becomes 2.5% of the total number of people who appears then you have to cross through the Viber process then it becomes 2.27% of the total number of people who initially uh uh applied and out of that 2.27 then you apply the Kota so most of the cases those who could be the beneficiary of the quota could not even make it to that level of Merit that list so therefore you can never apply the 100% quota that is there so that was also unclear to many people and we repeatedly try to clarify this look that we are not against Merit we are in favor of Merit we are not uh for discrimination we are against discrimination we also said that your demand your position is against discrimination so is our position your position is for merit so is our position I can show you it is documented many a times we I myself made this statement to the media and told them there's no I don't see any difference between your position I our position we can easily solve it through the judicial process you don't have to go to the street block the roads and uh put people to sufferings and create a tension and potentially you know a clash and then eventually casualties that's not necessary all those people died totally unwanted understood arat understood Mr Arafat um let me underline of course the big difference between your position and the protester position is that the government controls the authorities the police the Army I want to talk about the Authority's handling of what has happened here because you may be Keen to clearly blame the opposition or so-called miscreant as you've called them but it is essentially the government that is responsible for security and if the numbers are to be believed indirectly or directly responsible for the deaths of at least 150 people okay let me give you an example that will help you understand this you know uh that's how I want to answer this question see the Bangladesh television the BTV it's one of the key Point installations I received a call on that day when they were attacked from the employees and the DG of the television they're saying that they are hostage inside and they're in a life-threatening situation they're all in a shaky and fearful voice they're almost crying and asking me to send troops to help them so there are supposed to be some policemen already there guarding that institution but all those police got outnumbered and because they were not permitted to open fire they were just individuals and all those miscreant went inside the bdv literally invaded and set fire and started you know uh vandalizing and you know destroying all the uh all the assets and then the other people who had somehow you know Finding someplace to hide themselves they did not know what to happen to them then we sent another group of bgb troops and then they outnumbered them also because they were not allowed to open fire that's why they could not resist them and the they this miscreen and I would want to call them terrorist if you come to uh Bangladesh and visit BTV and if you look around it you see some of the part of the BTV looks like Gaza okay it looks like it has been bombarded that way it has been burn down so in a situation like that what do you do I think okay look let me summarize here tell let me summize those because what you have what you've described a protest movement because largely in part has been described as that you've described them as miscreant you've described them as terrorists and you've Des describe the uh alleged attack on the broadcasting Center um as essentially uh an attempt of some sort of katar comparing the situation to to Gaza let's not forget that amongst many of the Dead are young people in their 20s people who were studying at universities who wanted a change of the law is it healthy to describe those who are opposed to your position in such colorful terms we are not talking about the students we're not referring to the students to be the terrorist and Anarchist it is the third party those who intruded into this movement and started doing all this who do you think who do you think indulge into the jailbreak and and uh help 820 prisoners to escape who do you think is uh is invading into the jail and then uh loot the firearm please tell us who do you think that that is please help us 60 the prison staff hostage please help us with who you are all those things had happened here it's all so this is this is the third party all the extremist and the terrorists those who have the track record of doing all of this even in the past back in 2015 201 uh3 and if you go back to the track record and look at it you'll find out one last thing I want to tell you again Those Who attack and those who get attacked cannot be equally responsible for any clashes and in in as a result of that any any casualties but no matter what happened we are going to investigate everything thoroughly and we are going to bring everyone responsible for this casual let me let me let me get this straight so to the people of our country as as a defense for the way in which the military the police acted you say that they cannot be accused of acting the way they did if they were attacked first I mean you're talking about a a a democracy here we're talking about uh a government that is in charge of State security saying that uh we did what we did because we're attacked first is that the the way is that the way a healthy democracy acts you know the problem for uh the outside media media abroad for them to uh comprehend the situation uh is happen happening is because everyone is stuck into a binary equation everyone is thinking the protesters who are students and then the government is there they're having a clash but that's not how it is there's another factor in the equation which is a third party and the third party is the BNP and jamat terrorist and the anarchist who in who intruded into the equation and creating all this haboc so this third party had has this had this track record previously and we have this evidence and it was getting quite obvious who are doing it because the students could not do it it is not possible for the students to go inside all the government establishment and uh attacking and burning it down they attack the metro station they attack the Mr how many 235 police facilities I understand I understand that you are accusing this third party without substantiating any of that so far but what I'm saying to you is not that what I'm saying to you is that we do not know ultimately what these thirdparty groups were doing or what they were planning we cannot substantiate any of that independently but it is at the end of the day the government's responsibility for State security and you must agree that something very seriously went wrong here no no no hold on of course we are we we as a government of course it is our responsibility to bring back the peace and we did everything that you need to do to bring back the peace we have to do it because it's our responsibility to protect the lives of the people therefore we tried our best to diffuse the tension as much as possible we tried our best to deescalate the tension so that we can quickly bring back the peace but because of the you know some people who are trying to add fuel to the fire are trying to create a situation where they can you know take advantage of it and topple the government they went to that extent we believe and it is getting more obvious now made it difficult for us Mr AR we agree then that it is the the government's ultimate responsibility to maintain State security that's clearly has in many ways crumbled over the past couple of weeks who Bears the responsibility surely the buck stops with the Prime Minister know should she resign I mean she should resign for protecting the people she's the one who is protecting the people she's the one who's trying to deescalate the tension she's the one who's trying to diffuse the tension and trying to protect the people trying to save the people from the anarchist trying to save the people from the terrorist trying to save the people from the attackers those who are attacking and uh we got attacked so we fought back and tried to defend and because of that the clashes broke out and because of that there's the casualties the prime minister's responsibility is to bring everyone to book through a thorough investigation that's what she's trying to do and in a situation like that a prime minister should try to protect the people that's why she got the military uh out from the Barak to make sure the people are protected so for uh helping the people protecting the people trying to bring back the peace why on Earth the Prime Minister should resign for that we're talking about 150 at least people dead we don't have the official figures because your government will not release them uh as yet it's hardly it's hardly an exemplary handling of a situation okay so the thing is I didn't want to discriminate uh between the people who got dead but do you know there's so many students those who belong to the student wing of awami League they were thrown from the roof and they died there were policemen who was killed and hanged on the pole his dead body one of the former mayor was brutally attacked and he's fighting with life and death situation in the hospital one of his assistant got killed and he was also hanged on the pole on the tip of the pole like Jesus Christ so all those things had happened those who were attacked again we were under attack we are the one fought back and defend ourselves and trying to bring the peace back so that those who attacked they are responsible or those who got attacked they're responsible for this you are basically saying that amongst those people who died are people who were also sta supporters of the aami league that doesn't in any way make the security situation any better uh and at the end of the day it requires as you've mentioned a independent investigation to find out exactly what happened who will be conducting that inv investigation who will be conducting that investig and when will we expect results okay so the thing is uh the committee that independent judicial committee has been already formed and constituted headed by one of the senior Justice of the appell division of the Supreme Court and they will be investigating it they'll be investigating it and then we want to genuinely see a thorough investigation and the outcome of it because every single Casualty that happened actually made us victim of it made us victim of it because uh we did not want any chaos to happen in this country we wanted Law and Order situation to be uh controlled we wanted the peace to be there prevailed for the people we wanted the business as usual we wanted the development to go on instead of having destruction onto us uh you know the destroy they destroyed so many things so many government establishment and so much of losses all of these were absolutely unwanted unexpected and unnecessary especially when our position and the position of the students were at the same same position there yes one thing could have happened that I we're also guessing that uh the the way the group of people they planned it to take the whole thing to this direction we may not have been able to estimate or comprehend that in the first place so it got the whole country to this but eventually you've been able to uh you know withstand all this conspiracy and the pressure and we have been able to bring back the business as us ual now our first job would be to do a thorough investigation through this independent uh you know the judicial uh committee and then bring everyone to book who are responsible for this Mr Arafat your opponents accuse you of politicizing the situation there in the country before the full understanding of the investigation and what exactly happened is made public are you politicizing the situation to to undermine your political opponents and these so-called third party groups that you say were helping uh the violence uh an aspect that we saw in in Bangladesh are you politicizing things so the investigation those who will be investigating they'll do the thorough investigation more in-depth in investigation and they'll find find out the exact uh result what happened but what we are saying now is not that what we're saying is the looking at the destruction looking at the thing that happened jailbreak you know uh uh capturing the Firearms you know uh getting the The Prisoner to escape and those kind of things cannot be done by the students okay that has to be done by a group of people those who are who have done it before in the so that's a political understanding of us understood let's focus on what we do know as we reach the end of this discussion and what we do know is that the Prime Minister has been accused of adding heat to the situation of pouring fuel on the fire by referring to the protesters as rakas that essentially means traitors doesn't it I mean those people who sided with Pakistan to try and crush the independence movement was it right for the prime minister to call student demonstrators rakas she did not say that she did not say that she said something else and they misinterpreted and twisted her statement into something else so that they can antagonize their student and get get them out of the uh you know out of the halls and that's exactly what they did prime minister made her speech in the late afternoon and all the students started coming out at 11:30 p.m. at night in the middle of the night so they took some time to brainwash those student antagonized them and then planned it and got them out of the Halls at the middle of the night which was not legal and they broke down the gates and all that so they wanted this tension to to go up so this this is what we are sensing now it is becoming very obvious so those who wanted to create this uh tension and uh through this some kind of Chaos in the country so so you deny in any way that there was in any any way a decision by the the prime minister or any member of government to try and discredit and undermine what were originally initially quite legitimate student protests we never undermined any of their demands ever in any of our statements we repeatedly said what you are asking on the street you cannot change the Judgment of the high court in the street it has to be changed only through judicial process we are fighting your cause in the app division that's what we said if you are fighting if you if you are fighting their CA if you if you are fighting the student cause as you say in parallel uh would you then consider compensation for those killed will police and those described as quote hired thugs by the demonstrators be prosecuted compensation prosecution for those who have caused uh deaths or injuries in these clashes yes yes yes yes absolutely the Prime Minister already made this declaration and and one last thing to answer the another question the leaders of the BNP and its stud student Wing they publicly confirmed their covert participation if you scan through the their Facebook posts and messages it will be very very obvious to everyone how BNP and jamat cly intruded into this peaceful movement and turned the whole thing into a Mr AR as we've been saying throughout this discussion we do not have a member or members of the opposition right now the conversation is with you as a member of government we cannot substantiate or stand up any of the claims that you have made but as a last question I want to reflect on the health of democracy in Bangladesh because uh of course after elections were boycotted in by the opposition in January there are big questions about how fragile democracy is in Bangladesh at the moment and of course these violent demonstrations haven't helped have they okay first of all in the last election most of the registered party political party who are actually uh you know uh legally allowed to participate in the election they participated most party participated it is not correct that most party did not participate it is it was BNP and and jamat jamat is not registered and authorized to participate anyway BNP did not participate even though we uh repeatedly invited them to come and participate so it was totally their choice and their decision and we still believe they should have participated in the election because you should participate and if there's something wrong then you can identify and fix it we don't say that our democracy and democratic system is foolproof and absolutely perfect we don't say that we have long way to go but we're in the process of going democ is something which is which gets fine tuned and improved through practices but we do not get any cooperation from the opposition to uh get it improved because we tried our best to uh strengthen the election commission we tried our best to empower and make it more transparent through many reforms initiatives as many as 82 reforms initiatives has been taken by this government in last 15 years to empower the election commission get it separated from the government and make it stronger so that in the future we are looking ahead in the future that we want to give it a strong foundation on democracy and electoral process into Bangladesh but we need some support from the opposition for this to cooperate with us and do it but they are only in the process of boycotting in the process of of you know looting and and arsoning and and destruction Muhammad Arafat minister of State for information and broadcasting thanks for joining us on talk to Al jazer thank you thank you thank you very much for having me\"),\n",

curfew killings and a Communications blackout so will this move appease angry students and what's behind the recurring unrest this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program I'm Muhammad jamj after weeks of widespread unrest in Bangladesh the Supreme Court has changed a controversial quota system for government jobs it significantly reduced the share of public sector positions reserved for War veterans family members but despite the ruling the protests appear to be far from over initially student LED they've grown to include people frustrated by Rising inflation and high food crisis dozens of student leaders activists and opposition figures have been arrested with soldiers on the streets a nationwide curfew is in place and a Communications blackout there are also growing calls for prime minister sheikina to take accountability so what does this mean for her government and will the quota reforms be enough to restore calm we'll explore these issues with our guests in a moment but first this report by kacha Lopez hodan the Supreme Court in Bangladesh appears to have listened to tens of thousands of angry students after weeks of demonstrations and police crackdowns the top Court scaled back a quota system for government jobs the protest began in early July after the reinstatement of a controversial policy which reserved more than half of government jobs for minorities and relatives of veterans who fought for independence in 1971 now the court has reduced that share from 56% to 7 article 104 that means 93% of the quota will be for the general public 5% for Freedom Fighters and their relatives 1% for ethnic minorities and 1% for transgender and physically disabled applicants initially led by students the protest grew to include people frustrated with high inflation and Rising food prices the government deployed the Army to enforce a nationwide curfew and cut mobile and internet service to ensure security it said more than 100 people have been killed thousands injured people were killed and tortured they were killed with government's permission as they called for reforms to the quota system the state should take responsibility it is a matter of common sense that more than 50% of the jobs cannot be given away to quota holders a normal State cannot be run like this the unrest points to a wider frustration with the governing awami League 7 months ago prime minister shik Hina won a fifth term in elections critics described as a sham the opposition boycotted the vote accusing her of corruption and suppressing dissent about 20,000 opposition activists were arrested but this time the government says it invited students to talks students who are against the we welcome them and put their proposals up for discussion our honorable prime minister Shake Hena also welcomes their input government supporters point to the economic transformation under hena's leadership which Has Lifted millions of people out of poverty despite that nearly 20% of the population is out of work or school and hena's government is facing a new push back led by a younger generation Kia Lopez oan Al jazer for insight story all right let's go ahead and bring in our guests joining us from Sydney is mubashar Hassan a political analyst and post-doctoral fellow at the University of Oslo in Athens Ohio Muhammad Ashraf Zaman is an exiled Bangladeshi human rights activist and researcher at Ohio University and in New Delhi we have Sada dat a professor at the Jindal School of International affairs her research focuses on Bangladesh India relations a warm welcome to you all and thanks so much for joining us today on Inside Story mbasha let me start with you today Bangladesh's Supreme Court has scaled back this controversial quota system but it did not abolish it will this ruling be satisfactory to all the students who've been protesting and demanding an end to this system so I think there will be we we can only say what would be the exact reaction of student once the um you know communication blackout would be lifted the Press uh blackout that would be lifted and so forth so but it seems to me that that Cota movement would not be confined within just about Kota anymore because there are a lot of young kids have been um you know shot dead um there are a lot of young kids who demanded a rightful demand to their estate were traumatized ended up injured in hospitals and also uh some of them are forcefully disappeared and then only to be returned and so forth so I think there will be a lot of anger frustration resentment um so this kot movement I do not think it is confined in K movement anymore and and muasher if I could just follow up with you and and ask you what what are some of the other root causes of of the anger that's being displayed in these protests so first of all you know this is a Young Generation who I call Generation Z and um none you know a large portion of Young Generation were not being able to cast their vot so there is a disconnection between the state and this Young Generation who are millions in numbers and they saw that when they rais their demand there's a group of civilians who work in tandem with law enforcement agencies attack them it happened during the road safy movement it happened during the previous Kota movement and it happened now again so there is a sense that they are not really um being able to pursue their Dem and the state is really listening to them you know we need to be mindful that before this mindless violence and this chaotic situation this whole problem is created by the government I mean it was kind of settled previously uh during the previous kod movement which take place in 2018 and then suddenly it it was brought back and reintroduced and before this events turn to turn deadly they were ridiculed they were intimidated they were bullied by the uh rhetorics by prime minister rhetoric by law Minister and so for um and then you know it just went out of control and yeah s i I saw you reacting to what mubashar was saying there it looked like you wanted to jump in so please go ahead yeah it's right now as we see it I mean the temples of course are over the Kota movement we've also seen a supreme court you know CH the numbers drastically but I mean I completely agree with what M was saying that it's a cumulation of many other factors not only the previous quota movement really but the kind of you know uh I I think the government hasn't addressed many of the problems the youth and the youngsters are facing right now the highest level of unemployment but at the same time if you see the government has been completely lacad isical about the kind of high level of corruption slight of money all that doesn't escape them and they here they are and you know you're completely diluting meritocracy in the you know in the in this nation and giving chances to uh children on a very very uh unfair platform and also of course there again uh the January elections were something that the students didn't feel very happy about there many first time voters who are very disappointed and not only this election even the previous election it's a you know it's anger resment which has grown over the years with sunle and that that point that he made that while they were protesting they they've done this earlier it's not the first time the reaction by the government was unprecedented it's very unfair and certainly very derogatory but still this and then of course you saw the very high-handed way the government you know try to take charge so all of that is really added to this uh very very difficult and hostile situation on the ground so Sada it sounds to me as though you and mubasher are are saying that these protests that may have started out a as against the quota system that perhaps they have coales around an anti-government message would you say that these now have become anti-government demonstrations I would think so I certainly would think so because the resent was building I mean there were many other small you know incidents which were brought to light but again as I said the government wasn't addressing them and the students felt that many of their what they were asking for what they were demanding were completely ignored and denied so I think this was that particular moment when all the temples just were you know they were really hackled at this point yeah Zaman from your perspective will the student protesters be satisfied with this decision from the Supreme Court is it enough that there will just be a reform of the quota system or do they want to see it completely abolished thank you very much for having me uh what I would say that first of all the Supreme Court has to say uh tell to the people very explicitly that what do they mean by this because the Supreme Court's two tires the high court division in the past it uh granted the quota system to be uh reinstated and then now the the appelate division is saying uh completely a different way but at the same time it is also uh giving the authority to the uh government that if the government wants it can keep it it can uh I mean whatever they want to do with the Cota system they can exercise their uh discretion so in that case in one hand it is empowering the government to make its own decision and and if Sheik's government remains in office then you don't know because the same government in 2018 they publicly declared uh that the C system will be uh abolished and it was reinstated I mean using the Supreme Court and in Bangladesh also I need to say this that the people uh have very high uh uh distrust on the Judiciary because of his uh absence of Independence and we can also cite many examples that the Judiciary as a whole is not independent so in this case I'm I don't think that the people and the protesters in general will be trusting the Court's ruling and that will uh bring uh the protest to an end Zaman if I could also just ask you what are some of the other demands from the student leaders in this protest movement so far the the prot movement they they have some eight specific demands uh that the people they were involved in uh killing the protesters they should be identified and investigated and that includes the members of the law enforcement agencies the members of the ruling party student wi in particular the Bangladesh chatra League who uh escorted with the police they came up uh to uh attack the male and female uh protesters very brutally with the sharp and bl blunt weapons and also Firearms uh they also demanded that uh the The Killing that has been Unleashed by the government has to be ended and a complete probe has to be there and the the the detained people has to be released and all the fabricated cases that has been there it has to be resolved so the they have a lot of other demands on on that and of course the bringing the Kota system to the minimum like according to the Constitution in line with the uh the realistic requirement of the uh underprivileged people who deserve a Cota system not according to the relationship with a particular group of people mubasher um protesters are now also demanding the resignation of sheina how much pressure is she currently under and and what does this turmoil mean for the prospect of her longer term rule so I mean the there there there are group of people there are groups in the society they have been foring this concern for a while um I think what this Koda movement has done is that it kind of underpin uh the legitimacy crisis for the prime minister here um it was quite evident through the reaction of the government to this protester that um by calling them rajakar which is very derory term and kind of underpin anti-national element or anti-state element it goes back to the history of Bangladesh's Independence War um it effectively shows to many protesters uh from the videos that I gathered is that uh this prime minister is not prime minister for everyone which she needed to show uh that you know she's the Prime Minister for everyone including the people who holds different opinion so there is this legitimacy crisis I think which is going to run deep in this Society even though uh the whole thing is now framed about this High Court rule we need to underpin that there are like over 130 people dead what and you know they have families they have their relative soci and and and wider social connections what will happen to those debts we don't even know and this sense of grievances is very problematic in in a country which is full of young people if you look into the demography of Bangladesh as SRI da said that you know there a lot of people are unemployed and also there are you know most people in Bangladesh didn't born before 1971 were now but this government has been uh and you know it is it is a it is a it is a it is a defining word for the nation state and obviously it is important but if it is quite it is quite painful to see that if someone uh practices their legitimate right to protest they will be identified as someone who acted against the state during 1971 war and you know that whole War narrative what is the point of War narrative after 50 years of uh Independence we should we should invest our time energy money and politics in rebuilding and progressing the country so have so that grievances would be a problem uh for some time and for longer time and finally I want to underpin that the videos I've seen the state authorities have um have lost their legitimacy too um in a way that you know protester really didn't care about and show respect to the police anymore that's really problematic so what the state is doing now they are um forcefully asserting trying to asserting fear and which kind of which kind of um which kind of acted as an effective tool the I'm sorry to interrupt you it's just that I I do see Sada and she's reacting to what you're saying so I want to give her a chance to jump in as well but but also sh I want to ask you about the fact that there's there's soldiers on the streets there's a nationwide curfew uh that's been in place uh Communications Blackout um there are also growing calls for shikina to take accountability do you think that's going to happen because mubashir was just saying that she and her government that they're having a legitimacy crisis I mean how do you see this playing out I agree with this and I just recently just couple of hours ago saw ninepoint Demand by Abdul khader who's one of the leaders of the organizing the anti-protesters team and you know the first thing that they listed out was that they want an apology from the Prime Minister about what has happened and the way the government has uh you know used thepress so harshly and strongly and of course resignation of another Minister and you know basically accountability I completely agree that the students are a systemic change uh this is through the quar issue that they've raised these issues but they have I think they're very very uh exasperated with the way that the country has moved in the last couple of years while it has done wonders in many ways we've seen how till about year and a half ago it was you know his GDP was Rising growing one the fastest growing State nation in Asia and from there the way the you know the economic conditions have really really gone down the rabbit hole if I may use the expression and it's always falls on the youth it's always and if you look at the way things have and it's all in the public domain despite the kind of harsh censorship of the media and the Civil Society and U even in the the NGO sector which has actually been a very very robust sector in Bangladesh and has contributed to Bangladesh's growth story uh despite that we've seen how this government has used every tool possible in their hands to come down and any voice any act which you know doesn't completely with themselves with the particular political part play so all of that is I think is you know kind of a part of the boil that we see just now on the streets and I I think that's a valid point that you know they're not scared of the security forces of course it's curfew just now but what of little information the videos we saw that they were willing to face the tacks they're willing to face we've saw we've seen some helicopters and some dust terminating so really not sure what kind of uh you know measures that were being used but clearly the government was not even open to a dialogue at this point of time which they could have reached out they were using trying to control it to uh you know security apparatus which clearly was not working Zaman do you believe there's going to be growing calls for Sheik Hina to resign and and do you think that that is a a scenario that is in any way possible given the current climate in Bangladesh of course it's it won't be a call it is the call of this hour and you need to see Sheik Casina and her Legacy for example how do we trust sheikina when there have been over 700 enforced disappearances during her regime since January 29 2009 there are nearly 3,000 extrajudicial executions under Sheik hassina and none of these cases have been investigated or uh the victims have given an universal access to Justice in the country and then you look at the non-state actors violence like this ruling party student wings and their other gos they're attacking people all the time and this is state is very systematically using these forces then you see the cryptocracy that sheikina has established in like Russian oligarchy system that there are couple of privileged businessmen or the companies they grab all the institutions as many as possible and now the gramine bank for example founded by Professor Mohammad un has been their target to come under their control so and then you are dis disenfranchising the population for example around 30 million people who have been uh 18 years old uh during the regime of shikina they have never given a chance to cast their vote we see that according to the Bangladesh Buu of Statistics information there have been 2.5 million uh 90,000 uh unemployed people educated unemployed people in in Bangladesh and the youth educ unemployment rate is over 80% so uh that includes the sheikina I mean whatever development that people talk about sheikina you also need to see the picture quite fairly that whether there has been any justice given or the government has ever shown its attitude that it has any system of political or judicial accountability in the country so if the answer is a no then Sheik's time is over and she must go as immediately as possible that's what I feel the people are demanding at the moment mubashir um dozens of student leaders activists and opposition figures have been arrested how much has that exacerbated the situation that exed situation quite badly CU you know um one as I mentioned for fear has been the key tool of suppressing opinion but it was like pressure cooker situation it it was bound to happen on to you know someday and um and people you know the the reaction of the students are so uh Fearless so far that kind of will aggravate the situation further and I think what is going to take place is that there is no justification of uh 130 people being dead over a demand that you know student wanted a fairer access to the government service job that's as simple as that right and that situation led to something that shows that you know this is an incapacity of managing a state in a compassionate Manner and Bangladesh is a small country geographically but it's a huge country population wise and the way that economy and everything is being shut down I think you know those arrest and those repression on the students are going to uh linger from this point forward s um critics have described the last election in Bangladesh that sheina won as a sham the opposition in Bangladesh boycotted the vote they accused her government of corruption they accused her government of suppressing dissent what has all this done when it comes to Sheikh's standing in the International Community well so far as you know some of our partners are concerned it's India and China I think they have been pretty much supportive uh we have seen USA certainly you know raise issues but again so far as Europe and other states are concerned I don't think they have uh they had raised some concerns before the elections but surprisingly uh post elections one was you know surprised to see that not too many make are making any sounds about it that's I mean I would think that's rather unfortunate really uh and us as you know I think St their reaction has been quite quiet post the election there has been some you points here and there already but not the way they had initially uh was trying to ensure that a multi party free democratic election should be held but when that wasn't the case uh I didn't see anybody really come out very strongly against what bangadesh is do and sper we only have a couple of minutes left but let me just ask you um do you think that we could start seeing any anti-india sentiment in Bangladesh I ask because the public believes that India remains Sheikh's strongest backer so does this start taking a turn into anger also being expressed towards India in fact post the elections we did see though it was a social media movement confined largely there to that level didn't pick up any momentum for you know other than that it was called the quit India where they didn't want to buy the essential Goods that that do
